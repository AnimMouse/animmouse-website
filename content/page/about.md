Hi! I'm a person with interest and knowledge about computers and currently pursuing Computer Science.

Name Etymology:
Back in the days around 2010, when I play GTA San Andreas SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer), I want my username to be "Anonymous" but because I was young at that time (I'm still learning English at that time), I misspelled it into AnimMouse and since then, I'm using it on Minecraft, etc. and that's the story of my username.
