Hi! I'm a person with interest and knowledge, and loves to harness the power of computers, currently pursuing Computer Science.

My computer journey:\
In 2007, when I was 4 years old, my parents brought a computer in our home, we did not have internet at that time, my favorite program is Microsoft Paint on Windows XP, that is the program I always play. On around 2008, my parents brought Microsoft Encarta in DVD, that introduced me to Encarta Kids. On 2009, we finally have internet and the rest is history.\
I started programming around 2011, and my first programming language is batch file scripting, [ScrewTheLotOfYou's](https://www.youtube.com/@ScrewTheLotOfYou) batch scripts are what inspired me to do programming. Fast-forward to 2018, I created an account on GitHub and started learning other programming language like Bash and PowerShell.\
By 2019, I started making this website for the purpose of documenting something I have done on computers, so that I can recreate what I did someday, and I can't believe that this website got popular, and the rest is history.

Username Etymology:\
Back in the days around 2010, when I play GTA San Andreas SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer), I want my username to be "Anonymous" but because I was young at that time (I'm still learning English at that time), I misspelled it into AnimMouse and since then, I'm using it on Minecraft, etc. and that's the story of my username.
