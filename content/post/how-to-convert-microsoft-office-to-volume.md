If you installed Microsoft Office retail license and your organization requires that you need to use KMS server to activate your installation, you need to convert it to volume license first in order for KMS to work.

If you installed Microsoft Office retail license and you want to activate/crack it using KMS_VL_ALL, you need to convert it to volume license first in order for KMS to work.

But if you are using Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS) instead, no need to convert it using this tool as it will automatically convert to volume.
