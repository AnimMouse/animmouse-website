TL;DR: Just the right abstraction.

Hugo provides the right abstraction for making websites, not to abstract, not to realistic.\
Writing pure HTML websites is to much work, you also need to make use every stylesheet is working on your website.\
Using a content management system like WordPress is so easy, to the point you don't know how your website works, unless you care about it.

Hugo, like any other static site generator like Jekyll, provides a just right abstraction, not to hard on writing HTML, and not to easy to the point you don't care about how your website works.

In static sites generators, sometimes when you need to really tweak your website, you also need to have some knowledge about HTML, unlike in CMS where you just what you see is what you get.

Well, the choice is yours, when you are driving, do you care how your car work? Do you use manual transmission instead of automatic transmission? It really depends if you want to learn, but if you really want to learn in how you website work, use a static site generator like Hugo.
