[Torrent Webseed Creator](https://github.com/AnimMouse/torrent-webseed-creator)

Webseeded Torrent Creator using GitHub Actions.

An alternative to [BurnBit â€ ](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022643/http://burnbit.com/) and [URLHash](http://www.urlhash.com/).

I made this because of the shutdown of BurnBit and the sometimes not working URLHash.

For people who wants to create a torrent and backed by webseed.\
For people with a slow internet, create a torrent that is resumable.
