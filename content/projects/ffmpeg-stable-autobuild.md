[FFmpeg Stable Autobuild](https://github.com/AnimMouse/ffmpeg-stable-autobuild)

FFmpeg automatic stable build creator that uses GitHub Actions.

This uses the latest release build of FFmpeg, not the git build.

It uses [ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers](https://github.com/rdp/ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers) helper script to compile FFmpeg.

I made this because Zeranoe builds are shutting off on September 18, 2020, and I need FFmpeg of course.

And also that by building FFmpeg on my own I can basically make nonfree binaries of FFmpeg.
