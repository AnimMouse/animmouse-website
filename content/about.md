A person with interest and knowledge about computers.

Back in the old days, when I play GTA San Andreas multiplayer, I want my username to be "Anonymous" but because of my brain too small to spell (I'm still learning English at that time), I misspelled it into Anim Mouse and since then, I'm using it on Minecraft, etc. and that's the story of my name.
