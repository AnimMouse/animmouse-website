We got mentioned in weeklyOSM 579!

> Anim Mouse noticed a changeset that spans four continents and contains only a single change.
> Although it was pointed out in the discussion that a changeset should contain as small an area as possible, sometimes it is not possible when the element itself is very large, in this case France, including its overseas territories and d√©partements.
